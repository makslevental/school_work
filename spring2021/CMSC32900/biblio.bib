In this work, we implement an accelerator on FPGA for deep learning algorithms (CNN and RNN). The core computing module of the accelerator is a 32 * 32 systolic array of PEs. A mapping method for variable size of CNN and RNN algorithms is proposed. The experiment result shows that the maximum power consumption of the accelerator is 7.5W@100Mhz, the peak performance is 0.2Tops/s, and the real performance is 7.6Mops@100Mhz when running the 1st layer of LeNet-5.",
