abstract = {We consider stationary consensus protocols for networks of dynamic agents with fixed topologies. At each time instant, each agent knows only its and its neighbors’ state, but must reach consensus on a group decision value that is function of all the agents’ initial state. We show that the agents can reach consensus if the value of such a function is time-invariant when computed over the agents’ state trajectories. We use this basic result to introduce a non-linear protocol design rule allowing consensus on a quite general set of values. Such a set includes, e.g., any generalized mean of order p of the agents’ initial states. As a second contribution we show that our protocol design is the solution of individual optimizations performed by the agents. This notion suggests a game theoretic interpretation of consensus problems as mechanism design problems. Under this perspective a supervisor entails the agents to reach a consensus by imposing individual objectives. We prove that such objectives can be chosen so that rational agents have a unique optimal protocol, and asymptotically reach consensus on a desired group decision value. We use a Lyapunov approach to prove that the asymptotical consensus can be reached when the communication links between nearby agents define a time-invariant undirected network. Finally we perform a simulation study concerning the vertical alignment maneuver of a team of unmanned air vehicles.}

abstract = {We explore the computational power of networks of small resource-limited mobile agents. We define two new models of computation based on pairwise interactions of finite-state agents in populations of finite but unbounded size. With a fairness condition on interactions, we define the concept of stable computation of a function or predicate, and give protocols that stably compute functions in a class including Boolean combinations of threshold-k, parity, majority, and simple arithmetic. We prove that all stably computable predicates are in NL. With uniform random sampling of pairs to interact, we define the model of conjugating automata and show that any counter machine with O(1) counters of capacity O(n) can be simulated with high probability by a protocol in a population of size n. We prove that all predicates computable with high probability in this model are in P ∩ RL. Several open problems and promising future directions are discussed.},
